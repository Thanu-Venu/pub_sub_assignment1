# Task 4 – Architecture Enhancement for Availability and Reliability

## Objective
To propose an improved distributed architecture for the Pub/Sub middleware that avoids a single point of failure.

## Description
- The current system uses a single server, which is a single point of failure.
- A new distributed architecture is proposed to improve:
  - Availability
  - Reliability
  - Fault tolerance

## Proposed Solution
- Use multiple broker nodes
- Introduce primary–backup or broker federation architecture
- Enable failover and state replication

## Deliverable
- Architecture diagram
- Written explanation of improvements
- No implementation required
